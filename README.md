# SMMO
A friend told me about this game and how there are no public up-to-date bots available for it. I took it literal and coded a bot within hours. That was like 2 weeks ago. Kept this project private until now. Well, I won't provide you with the full functional bot, as I want you to use your braincells too.

Issues you will encounter on this game:
- ### Possible Bans
  - Figure out yourself how they knew that you were botting. Play less, make it more human-like.
- ### Captcha
  - That's where I am nice and provide you with one way to solve them in this repository.

Their captcha consists of 4 deformed game assets that get generated by their server. And the second I saw these captchas. I knew that I wouldn't have to pay cheap working indians sitting 8 hours a day in front of their desktop, 10 cents an hour, to solve the captchas I send them.

The Problem with this sort of captcha they use in SMMO, is, that using a image classification machine learning KI, you can pretty much programatically tell what the images in the captcha are. Once you have done the work to predefine what everything is and made the KI learn your learnset. Guess what, that's exactly what I did.

Microsoft's IDE *Visual Studio*, has an individual component in the installer called **ML.NET Model Builder (Preview)**. That's what I used to create the Model and generate the projects for me. Their project examples on GitHub are either outdated or don't come with the stuff you really need, throwing errors at you.

Using 4000 images (in this case), your KI can tell to 99%, what what is.
